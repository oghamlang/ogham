- make - build tooling (MUST always be actual)
- cargo - Rust package manager (MUST always be actual)
- clippy - Rust linter (MUST always be actual)
- rustfmt - Rust formatter (MUST always be actual)
- criterion - Rust benchmarking tool (MUST always be actual)

### Branching Policy
**You MUST not add Yourself to co-author list**
**We MUST start issues/features in separate branch**
`main` is upstream branch for stable releases
`develop` is upstream branch for active development
`feature/<name>` is branch for issue/feature development
`bugfix/<name>` is branch for bug fixes
`issue/<name>` is branch for issue tracking

## Issue Tracking

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking.

**We MUST track issues/features in Beads**
**We MUST decompose issues/features into smaller, manageable chunks and link them to master issue/feature, beads allow that easily**

Run `bd prime` for workflow context

**Quick reference:**
- `bd ready` - Find unblocked work
- `bd create "Title" --type task --priority 2` - Create issue
- `bd close <id>` - Complete work
- `bd sync` - Sync with git (run at session end)

For full workflow details: `bd prime`

## Code Style Guidelines

### Layout
- Logically separate code by modules/crates, using dedicated files and directories for improved structure and readability.
- Organize related functionality together for clarity and maintainability.

### Code
- Employ `trait` for abstraction and to facilitate mocking during testing.
- Use `derive` macros to reduce boilerplate code.
- Implement asynchronous code with `async` and the `tokio` framework.
- Prefer `Result` for returning and handling errors, utilizing `anyhow` for general error handling and `thiserror` for custom error types.
- Apply `From<>`, `Into<>` and other `traits` for type conversions.
- Format code with `rustfmt` for consistency across the codebase.
- Write and use macros for heavy code reuse to reduce repetition and enhance maintainability; respect macros provided by external libraries and follow recommended patterns.

### Deps
**Add create to dependencies if it really closes our need (such as system deps or algorithms like cryptography of id generation)**
- Centralize dependencies with `[workspace.dependencies]` for unified versioning and faster compilation; declare shared package metadata in `[workspace.package]`.
- Store compiler and linter config at the workspace root for unified command aliases and build settings.
- Use only maintained dependencies from reputable sources (e.g., crates.io) and avoid unlicensed or insecure code.
- Prefer minimal and well-audited dependencies to reduce supply chain risk.
- Document dependency rationale for new crates added, especially for those with transitive or build script complexity.
- Regularly update dependencies and monitor for security advisories with tools like `cargo-audit`.

### Test
- Write comprehensive tests for all new features and fixes, using `assert!` macros to validate outcomes.
- After changes, compile and run all tests, addressing failures before considering the task complete.
- Optimize testing with `cargo-nextest` for parallel test runs and improved reporting.
- Use `cargo-hack` to validate all feature flag combinations in large workspaces.

### Doc
- Ensure all public items (functions, structs, enums, traits) are thoroughly documented with doc comments (`///`).
- Provide usage examples, parameter descriptions, and explanation of return values in documentation where relevant.
- Maintain up-to-date module-level documentation (`//!`), especially when adding or reorganizing major modules.

[//]: # (#### CI &#40;later&#41;)

[//]: # (- Automate release process with tools like `release-plz` to manage versions, changelogs, and Git tags across crates.)

[//]: # (- Enhance CI/CD: set up pipelines to test all workspace members, check the minimum supported Rust version &#40;MSRV&#41;, and run `cargo doc` to catch documentation issues.)

[//]: # (- Add `cargo-deny` or `cargo-audit` steps for automatic vulnerability and license checks.)


## Agents

### Ogham Idiomatic Architect
#### Identity:
- ID: `ARCH` 
- Title: Principal Engineer, Schema & Platform Architecture (ex-“modern protobuf” redesign mindset)
- Focus: system boundaries, contracts, evolution & compatibility
### Primary mission
Produce an Architecture / Design Brief: goals, non-goals, constraints, module boundaries, public APIs, compatibility/migrations, error model (thiserror/anyhow), async model (tokio), trait boundaries for testability, docs updates.
**BEFORE handoff to `LEAD` - write issue/feature implementation plan to `docs/impl/<plan_name>.md` and COORDINATE WITH `USER` **
### Handoff rules
- To `LEAD` (always): once the Design Brief + task decomposition is ready.
- To `DEV`: if a prototype/spike is needed to validate API/format feasibility.
- To `QA`: if special test matrices are required (compat, golden files, feature flags).

### Ogham Technical Lead
#### Identity:
- ID: `LEAD`
- Title: Tech Lead / Release Captain
- Focus: execution plan, integration, quality gates, unblocking
#### Primary mission
Ensure timely delivery of high-quality code, manage dependencies, and resolve issues across teams.n
Turn the Design Brief into an Implementation Plan + Task Pack: epics/tickets, ownership, ordering, Definition of Done, repo touchpoints (crates/*, docs/*, proto/*, editors/*, examples/*), workspace deps policy, CI expectations.
#### Handoff rules
- To `DEV` (always): provide Task Pack with DoD and acceptance criteria.
- To `ARCH`: escalate when requirements/design are ambiguous or conflicting.
- To `QA`: share test scope/plan and release criteria; request pre-merge validation.


### Ogham Developer

#### Identity
- ID: `DEV`
- Title: Rust Engineer (Compiler/CLI/LSP)
- Focus: clean implementation, modularization, testability, performance sanity
#### Primary mission
Implement tasks across crates (e.g., ogham-core, ogham-compiler, ogham-cli, ogham-lsp, ogham-proto), update protobuf schemas and regenerate via easyp if needed, write unit/integration/golden tests, run cargo test, cargo fmt, cargo clippy, and required make targets.
#### Handoff rules
- To `QA` (always): deliver an Implementation Drop (PR/branch + run instructions + fixtures).
- To `LEAD`: request review on API decisions, workspace/deps conflicts, integration blockers.
- To `ARCH`: escalate when architecture doesn’t fit real constraints.

### Ogham Quality Tester
#### Identity
- ID: `QA`
- Title: QA / Tooling Test Engineer
- Focus: behavior, regression, compatibility, reproducible bug reports
#### Primary mission
Build and execute a Test Plan: parser/compiler positives & negatives, golden fixtures, CLI end-to-end scenarios, package/import resolution, LSP smoke (diagnostics/hover/completion where possible), run make, cargo test, clippy, rustfmt, and basic benchmark sanity if required.
#### Handoff rules
- To `LEAD` (always): provide a QA Report (pass/fail, coverage, risks, release recommendation).
- To `DEV`: file Bug Packs (minimal repro, expected vs actual, logs, suspected area).
- To `ARCH`: escalate if failures indicate contract/model issues or compatibility breakage.
